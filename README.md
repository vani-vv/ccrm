# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) - Java Project
Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a console-based Java SE application designed to manage students, courses, and enrollments in a university setting. It supports student/course CRUD operations, enrollment management, grade recording, and transcript generation. The system also includes file I/O for CSV import/export, ensuring data can be saved and retrieved easily.

The project demonstrates core OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism), uses design patterns (Singleton, Builder), and applies modern Java features like Streams, Lambda expressions, and the Date/Time API. It has a menu-driven CLI interface that works in both interactive and demo modes, making it user-friendly and adaptable.

Overall, CCRM serves as a mini student information system that showcases strong Java programming practices with real-world educational data management.
